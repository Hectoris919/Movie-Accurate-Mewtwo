# Movie Accurate Mewtwo Pose Dolls for Clip Studio Paint

#### I wasn't able to find any 3D models that capture how the Mewtwos from Movies 1 and 16 are portrayed, so I decided to make my own.
##### In my previouse experiances, rigged eyes and Clip Studio Modeler do not mix well, so the models I made have blank outlines where the eyes should be drawn

### Disclamer:

The pose doll's thighs are poorly rigged and deform incorrectly when they are rotated in certain ways.

To mitigate this problem, I added a "Correction Bone" to each thigh that allows you to move around the deformed thigh to get a desired look on the model.

It's not perfect, but it gets the job done. I will update this rig when I find a better solution to this problem
