### Disclamer:

Thighs are poorly rigged and deform incorrectly when they are rotated in certain ways.

To mitigate this problem, I added a "Correction Bone" to each thigh that allows you to move around the deformed thigh to get a desired look on the model.

It's not perfect, but it gets the job done. I will update this rig when I find a better solution to this problem
